## Overview

As automation, reproducibility, collaboration, and frequent reporting become increasingly expected in work around campus, R is a good option for staff looking to expand their toolchain. Integrating R into your workflow can increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks and eliminating error-prone copying and pasting. R enables staff to combine spreadsheet data with SQL queries from multiple servers. This colloquium will focus on data import and export, basic wrangling, visualization, and reporting with RMarkdown. We will emphasize conventions and best practices for working reproducibly and collaboratively with data, including naming conventions, documentation, and organization, all while “keeping the raw data raw”. Whether you are new to programming and want to get started in R, already working in R, and want tools for working more seamlessly with collaborators across campus, or have extensive reporting experience, this is the course for you!

## Learning objectives

Attendees will learn tools for integrating R into their existing data analysis workflow. Upon completing the workshop, participants will have learned the basics of working with data in R/RStudio, and will have experience generating automated reporting from multiple data sources.

## Is this course for me?

This colloquium will be appropriate for attendees who answer yes to these questions:

Have you ever used Excel and wished you could automate all the clicking and checking?
Have you ever wished you could pull from multiple databases and join the results?
Are you new to data analysis, and looking for a good place to get started?
